# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
# Project Overview
This project performs customer segmentation using K-Means clustering on the Mall Customers dataset. The goal is to identify distinct groups of customers based on their demographic and spending patterns, which can be useful for targeted marketing strategies.

# Libraries Used
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

numpy: Numerical computing.

matplotlib: Data visualization.

seaborn: Statistical data visualization.

scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and tools.

# Results
The K-Means clustering algorithm successfully identified distinct groups of customers based on their age, annual income, and spending score. The visualizations provide a clear understanding of the customer segments, which can be leveraged for targeted marketing strategies.
